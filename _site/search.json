    "text": "In search of causes; getting bogged down by correlations.\n\n\nA brief introduction of me.\n\n\n\n\nMy name is Jared Seneca Adam and I currently reside in Montana, where I spend most of my time running around the woods and clambering up rocks, all while looking at, and for, plants and arthropods. At present, I am a PhD student at Montana State University, where I study plant-arthropod interactions. I am deeply interested in population dynamics and the use modeling to understand the role of plant traits in response to abiotic and biotic stress. Additionally, I am fascinated by causation and am working on broadening my understanding of cause and effect, the role of cause and effect in Ecology, the age-old debate of Frequentsit vs. Bayesian, how we can use both of these pools of statistical thinking to produce appropriate models, and how we can train Ecologists both maximum likelihood and probability-based modeling to ensure our science is sound as we work to answer harder questions in an ever-changing environment."

    "text": "I am considered an Entomologist by most, a Quantitative Ecologist by some, and in a former life, I was an Agroecologist. I am from a small town in Northeastern Pennsylvania, where I spent much of my time wrestling, playing baseball, skateboarding, hunting, and fishing. Indeed, I was a bug kid, but it was not until my junior year of undergrad that I learned studying arthropods could be a career. From that moment on, I dedicated much of time to learning all I could about insects and other arthropods. I added the entomology minor to my course load which added a year to my degree, took graduate-level courses, sought internships with a focus on entomology, and started considering graduate programs. I finished my undergraduate degree with a major in Plant Sciences, Agroecology option, and minors in Entomology, International Agriculture, and Soil Science.\nUpon the completion of my undergraduate degree in December 2019, I joined Peace Corps Nepal. Regrettably, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March of 2020, the Peace Corps underwent a global evacuation from all countries. Upon returning to the US, I got a job in agri-chemical research at Lehigh Agricultural and Biological Services. I had interned here as an undergraduate, so, the transition to a full-time employee was all but seamless. In 2021, I went back to Penn State to work for Dr. John Wallace in the Weed Science department. While I loved working for Wallace, my passion was (and still is) entomology, and in 2022 I finally joined my first Entomology lab. In August of 2022, I started a Master’s degree with Dr. John Tooker.\nAt present, I am a PhD student of Dr. Will Wetzel in the Land Resources and Environmental Sciences (LRES) program in the College of Agriculture at Montana State University. I am broadly interested in how global environmental change drives plant-insect interactions. My work focuses on plant tolerance to herbivory and I seek to understand how plants can, or cannot, handle an increase in both abiotic and biotic stress. For example, how does an increase in abiotic stress drive insect-herbivore populations? What physiological traits do plants rely to handle an increase in the dual threat of abiotic and biotic pressure? Can we predict the role of arthropod predators in plant fitness?\nUpon the completion of my PhD, I would like to teach entomology and applied statistics and programming through an ecological lens. I see myself working at a small-mid sized R1 university, but am open to job opportunities that allow me to build curriculum. For more information about my teaching history and plans for the future, please see this page."
