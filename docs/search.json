At present, I am a PhD student at Montana State University, where I study plant-arthropod interactions. I am deeply interested in population dynamics and the use modeling to understand the role of plant traits in response to abiotic and biotic stress. Additionally, I am fascinated by causation and am working on broadening my understanding of cause and effect, the role of cause and effect in Ecology, the age-old debate of Frequentsit vs. Bayesian, how we can use both of these pools of statistical thinking to produce appropriate models, and how we can train Ecologists both maximum likelihood and probability-based modeling to ensure our science is sound as we work to answer harder questions in an ever-changing environment."
