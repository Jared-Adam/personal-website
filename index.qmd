My name is Jared Seneca Adam and I currently reside in Montana, where I spend most of my time running around the woods and clambering up rocks, all while looking at, and for, **plants and arthropods**. At present, I am a PhD student at Montana State University, where I study **plant-arthropod interactions.** I am deeply interested in population dynamics and the use modeling to understand the role of plant traits in response to **abiotic and biotic stress.** Additionally, I am fascinated by *causation* and am working on broadening my understanding of cause  and effect, the role of **cause and effect in Ecology**, the age-old debate of *Frequentsit vs. Bayesian*, how we can use **both** of these pools of statistical thinking to produce appropriate models, and how we can train Ecologists both **maximum likelihood and probability-based modeling** to ensure our science is sound as we work to answer harder questions in an *ever-changing environment*.
